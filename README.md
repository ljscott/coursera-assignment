# coursera-assignment
  #There are four parts to my assignment.
  
    #1-The code is for my file called run_analysis.R which sits in my local R Studio.
    #2-The text file that the code creates (called "seconddataset.txt") was uploaded.
    #3-The codebook with the variables was added
    #4-This readme file summarizes my work
    
  # The code carries out the following steps 
  
    #-downloads and unzips files from an internet site
    #-selects variables, structures files and binds them into a single file
    #-renames columns with meaningful labels
    #-groups by activity/subject then aggregates means for each measure.
